# UsaidsPasswordGenerator
This is my random password generator.
When clicking the generate password button, you are met with a prompt asking you to enter your password length. Clicking "ok" presents you with the next prompt asking you if you'd like you include lower case letters then uppercase then numbers and finally special characters. After clicking OK on the final prompt, your password is then generated into the box on the page. 

How do i give the options of yes and no rather than OK and cancel as i feel this would be more user friendly?

Thank You ~Usaid
